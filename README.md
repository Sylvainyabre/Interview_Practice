# Implementation of common algorithms and data Structures

In this project, I implement all the data structures with their most common operations.Below are the data structures and algorithms that I intend to implement.

- [x] Linked list
   - [x] push
   - [x] pop
   - [x] reverse
- [x] Binary Search Trees
   - [x] pre-order traversal
   - [x] in-order traversal
   - [x] post-order traversal
   - [ ]  level-order
   - [ ]  inverse
   - [ ]  isBinarySearchTree

- [ ] AVL trees
   - [ ] insert
   - [ ] delete

- [ ] B trees

- [x] Stack
   - [x] push
   - [x] pop
   - [x] peek
   - [x] isEmpty
   

- [x] Queue
   - [x] push
   - [x] pop
   - [x] peek
   - [x] isEmpty

- [ ] Graph

- [ ] Hash tables

- [x] Sorting

- [x] Quick sort

- [x] Merge sort

- [x] Selection sort
